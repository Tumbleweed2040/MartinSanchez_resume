        <p class="lead mb-4">The road to becoming a teacher was a road that wasn't very shared nor was it very common. I first attended UCR as undeclared as I didn't know what I wanted to major or focuse my time on. 
        <br><br>

        When I first enlisted in the military, it was to secure a future for myself and for the woman I was with at the time. Times have changed and I have shifted my focus to finishing my career in the military. I enlisted under a contract that would entail my committment to 
        the military for 6 years. I enlisted when I was in my freshman year of college, it was at a time where I was on the cusp of being academically dismissed due to my low GPA from my past two quarters,. Over time, I realized that if I was able to surpass great odds and 
        complete various grueling tasks in the military that taxed both my body and mind, then there's nothing I can't do. 
        <br><br>

        During the Summer of 2019, I was trying to find work at any place I could find due to the lack of work on Campus for Student Services. I was applying at every spot that I could think of, revising my resume, and making sure I went to Job fairs when I had the time. 
        Yet, it was still difficult to find work even with my past military experience and years of work. So when I finally found a job as an AVID tutor, it was perhaps the greatest feeling I had felt in a while and it jump-started my pursuit in becoming a teacher. Now that
        I have almost two years of experience with AVID, and have been helping many of my students with understanding their class materials. I even reached out in providing my services to many families who have kid. With the pandemic,a lot of tutoring has to be done via Distance
        Learning. While challenging, I have been slowly adjusted to such challenging circumastances by implementing various methods of learning strategies that have benefited my students.
